Greetings! My name is Hannah Tager and I am a senior History major at Williams College. While I love history and reading (check out [my goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15065927-hannah-tager/))!, I have also always loved to sew and craft in my downtime. For friends and myself I have sewn and knit sweaters, dresses, shorts, corsets, hats, and more! I can't wait to incorporate techonology into my designs and I hope to learn ways that circuitry can lead to more accessible and effective fashion designs. 

While I have never done formal programming before, I spent some time this summer working on the wordpress website for a non-profit. Had I known half the coding I know now I could've saved myself quite the headache--oh well!

Check out some examples of my work here:
