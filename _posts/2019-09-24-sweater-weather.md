Check out my clothing advice program! Depending on what temperature you put as the imput, the program (done using C) will tell you advice about how to dress and proceed with your life. 
I have put an image of the output below, but leave a comment if you're interested in trying it out for yourself.

In terms of advice to myself before going into the project, I would say to just concentrate on making the code as simple as possible. It is not necessary to include and and/or or clauses if they aren't, well, necessary!

An image of an output using an example temperature integer is attached below.
