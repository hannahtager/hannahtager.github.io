This program outpurs a vibration pattern to the Vibe Board Motor either of my name in morse code
 (when the circuit is open) or SOS (when the circuit is closed).
 
 In terms of tips, I had trouble because of the hardware. That's to say, the Vibe Board Motor is a little temperamental so if I didn't hold it a particular way, the motor wouldn't vibrate. 
 
 
 I don't have an image of anything vibrating, but here's a link to Rihanna's banger "SOS".
