While I have sewn in the past, this was my first attempt at a formal embroidary sewing sampler. I greatly enjoyed testing out the individual stitches. However, if I were to give my past self a tip, I would say it might be worth ironing the edge of the fabric before attempting the whip stitch and it also might be useful to invest in an embroidary hoop for the satin stitch. Otherwise, I think the project went pretty smoothly. See the results below!
