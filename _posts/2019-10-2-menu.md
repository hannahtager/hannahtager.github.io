For this project I created a program that, depending on both your inputs for "numberChoice" and "mealOption" will give you an output that is either a fun meal on the special menu, or a boring meal on the normal menu. 

My personal program can allow you to pick any number for both of the inputs. I could have also restricted it by rejecting a user's inputs for mealOption and only providing three viable meal options, but I wanted to try making as many functioning input/ouputs as possible. 

As a tip to my former self, I would say that I should figure out if the assignment is simpler than I initially think...That's to say, I had assumed that the program would need to work for all numberChoice and also mealOption inputs and produce meal options. I had fun figuring out how to do this using mod, but the assignment did not actually call for that. I could have just rejected a user's input and told them to pick a mealOption between 1-4, for example. 

Here is an image of an example output below:
