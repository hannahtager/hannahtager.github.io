Enjoy this image of an ASCII pizza with a brief visit from Pizza Rat--yum! My code, using the text editor Atom, is posted below. I have also included a screenshot of the code output. The ASCII picture itself is from https://www.oocities.org
```c 
// (c) 2019 hmt1, CS103
// Assignment: Hello, World!

#include <stdio.h>

int main ()
{
  printf("Hannah Tager\nCS103\t2019\n");
  printf("ASCII Art Extra Credit Assignment\n");

  printf(" || ""--.._\n");
  printf(" ||  (_)  _ ''-._\n");
  printf(" ||    _ (_)    '-.\n");
  printf(" ||   (_)   __..-'\n");
  printf(" ||__..--""\n");

  return 0;

}

```
