This program that simulates a loop turning different colored LED lights on. For every 10th time the variable runTime goes, a color (red, green, blue) is printed--but only 3 times each before switching color. 

A trick to my past self would be to figure out that you can make different variables to begin with, since I went in with the premise that you could only make an int runTimes. It was a lot easier to code when I realized I could make multiple counter variables.
