Accio arduino!

This program plays the Harry Potter theme song from the on-board arduino speaker when the switch is turned on. Once the switch is turned off, the music stops!

Simple!

Tips for the future: Use music code that utilizes a for loop because that makes it easier for the switch to make the song turn off. 

I don't have a picture of sound working -- lol -- but here's a Harry Potter photo and a photo crediting the code writer :)
