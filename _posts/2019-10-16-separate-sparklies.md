For this project I created a 3 separate programming sets that light up the ProtoSnap LEDS to light with 3 different patterns that demonstrate the flashing patterns of fireflies. 


One tip to my former self would be to not overthink things. I started dealing with millis(); and boolean functions where it wasn't necessary. Also, I had some issues with mod and making the synchronous file blink three times. 

Check the pictures below for photos of my arduino all lit up.
