A program that turns the on board RGB LED on with a random color only while a button is being pressed. 
Also, the LED can only light up according to the 12 colors shown on the color wheel below. 

As a tip to my past self I would say that I should maybe find a way to write the code without as many nested ifs. Oh well, it works for now :/

Here are pictures of the color wheel and the on board LED lighting up.
