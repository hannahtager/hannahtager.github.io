Help me welcome Slushie the Plushy into the world! I created this light-up stuffy using leds, a button, a switch and a battery pack from LilyPad Arduino components.

The sewing of the project was fairly simple, but I encountered some issues while prototyping the circuit: I had originally put all the components together in a parallel circuit. As it turns out, the button and switch need to be configured in a series. Because of this, my button and switch were not working properly as electron flow was stopped once I closed the circuit. I then had to resew the whole thing--alas. 

In terms of a tip to my former self or to any other person embarking on this project, I would say to not pick a felt fabric the same color as your conductive thread--this made it a little difficult to see my stitches. 

See some images below of my prototyping stage with a paper diagram, alligator clips, and then the finished project (front and back!).
