For this project I created a program that, depending on the status of the button and switch, produced the same results as [the physical plushy led project I sewed](https://hannahtager.github.io/2019-09-30-Plushy/).

A user can input either 0 (off) or 1 (on) for the status of the button and the switch. All leds should light up only in the case that both the button and switch are on. Otherwise, the three leds should not work. 

As a tip to my former self, I would be more careful with identation. Correctly identing can be very helpful with nested ifs.
