For this project I created a circuit on my sewing sampler to display homemade switches. I used a conductive thread patch, conductive fabric, and binder clips to create three switches.

These circuits switches connected to the multicolor leds that I placed in the petals of a lazy daisy. Unfortunately, due to energy loss from the circuits and perhaps a weak battery, only the first four leds lit up. In order to trouble shoot (I was scared the LED had burnt out), I removed the final led in the last petal of the flower. 

I hope to return and add a stronger battery so that all five petals can light up. As it stands, the fourth petal also only dimly lights up. It's alright for now, but would be a lot more pretty and satisfying if they all lit up beautifully. 

One trick is to be more aware of energy loss that can happen through switches. Had I known that, I wouldn't have been as ambitious and chosen five leds.
