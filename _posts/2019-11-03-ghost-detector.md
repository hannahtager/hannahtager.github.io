This is a program that uses the temperature and light sensors to determine if there's a ghost nearby. 
That's to say,it  will turn all the red LEDs, including the on-board RGB LED when it is dark enough and cold enough for ghosts to be nearby.

As a tip to my past self, I would say to try and find something cold enough to turn on the lights--I was stuck using water in a kombucha bottle!


Enjoy this picture of the lights on!
