subtitle: A little bit about Hannah

I am a senior history major at Williams college currently enrolled in Electronic Textiles! Learn a little bit about me by seeing [what books I read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15065927-hannah-tager) and [which songs I listen to!](https://sites.williams.edu/wcfm/) 

I am excited about taking this course because I have done a ton of costume design and crafting in the past (my favorite's knitting!) and I want to incorporate techonology into my pieces. I have a ton of ideas for projects and have been particularly interested in how electronic textiles can lead to safer and more efficient lifestyles. 

I hope you enjoy my site!

Comment a song or book below that you think I should check out next! And make sure to check my website often to see what projects I'm working on.
